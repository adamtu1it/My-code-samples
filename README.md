MazeApp

given some maze input files and the problem description 
I implemented a solution in C#:

1. create mazes by either randomly generating them or loading them from a directory that contains input files
2. wrote a Breadth First Traversal algorithm to find the shortest path from the start point 'S' to the destination 'E'   
3. display/write the plain maze or the maze with the solution: Console output or output files

the directories for the input and output folders can be found in the app.config file

easily maintainable and extendable and reusable 

read more about the problem description and maze represantion in the MazeProblemDescription.txt

Note:
one of the input maze is very large, in order to see the result don't forget to turn off the wordwrap to see the wide maze and be able to track the path from source to destionation
